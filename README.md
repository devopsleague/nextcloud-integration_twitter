# Twitter integration into Nextcloud

🐦 Twitter integration provides dashboard widgets displaying your important notifications and your home timeline.

## 🔧 Configuration

### User settings

The account configuration happens in the "Connected accounts" user settings section.

A link to the "Connected accounts" user settings section will be displayed in the widget for users who didn't configure a Twitter account.

### Admin settings

There also is a "Connected accounts" **admin** settings section if you want your Nextcloud users to use another OAuth application to authenticate to Twitter. The Nextcloud Twitter OAuth app is used by default.
